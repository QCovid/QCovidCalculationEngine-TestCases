# QCovidEngine-TestCases

These test cases have been provided by the University of Oxford as part of the CE Marking process for QCovid® Calculation Engine to validate it against the QCovid® algorithm as published in the BMJ. Before any CE Marked release of QCovid® Calculation Engine, all test cases are executed and must be passed. The same test cases have been used by licensees of the CE Marked version to ensure it is functioning correctly as installed on their own platforms and in their specific software environments.

These test cases are synthetic data, presenting as broad a range of combined parameters as possible, and designed to _validate_ the implementation, and ensure the QCovid® Calculation Engine functions identically to the published algorithm. They were not used in the original QCovid® algorithm development.

## Running test cases on [QCovid.org](https://qcovid.org)
These test cases can be run on [QCovid.org](https://qcovid.org).

## Running test cases with [QCovidCalculationEngine](https://github.com/QCovid/QCovidCalculationEngine)
To reproduce the results of these test cases the Townsend Deprivation Index database for QCovid® Calculation Engine is required. This module is not available on GitHub.

Details on the Townsend Score, and how to derive them from the 2011 census data can be found here: https://www.statistics.digitalresources.jisc.ac.uk/dataset/2011-uk-townsend-deprivation-scores, http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/statistics.digitalresources.jisc.ac.uk/dkan/files/Townsend_Deprivation_Scores/UK%20Townsend%20Deprivation%20Scores%20from%202011%20census%20data.pdf
